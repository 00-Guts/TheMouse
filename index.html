        <section class="main-content">
            <p>At the bottom of modern mice there is an Image Acquisition System (IAS), which is composed of an Infrared Led, a pair of Lenses and an Image pixel array. The Infra-red light, generated by the Led, passes through a lens and lights up the surface underneath the mouse. Then the IR reflected off the surface and passes through the second lens, then hits the Image Pixel Array, also called an Image Sensor. The IR Light allows the Image sensor to map a textured landscape of the surface. Then the Image sensor takes up to 17000 pictures, of the surface, per second. Every time it takes a picture, it compares it to the previous one. The microchip then uses the difference between them, in order to determine the change in X and Y axis

                One of the earliest concepts of the mouse was The Trackball, which was made as a part of an British Navy project to help track aircrafts on radar. The Trackball worked by having the "Ball" sit on top of spinning metal disks that were in contact with wires.<br><br>
                The first Mouse would be invented in 1964 at Stanford University. The mouse had two wheels that allowed movement either up and down or side to side, but not at the same time. Soon after that, the mouse was picked up by Xerox, who were developing "Ball" mice, which allowed movement in all directions.<br><br>
                The mouse was then popularised by Tech Companies like APPLE and Microsoft, in mid 1980's. The first widespread mouse that had an scroll wheel was released in 1996. At this time, Optical Mice were also being introduced to the public. However the development of optical mice that could work with generic surfaces, like mousepads and table tops, didn't happen until much later.<br><br>
                Optical mice had better tracking and were more relieable than ball mice. Optical sensors worked by taking many photos of the surface, that the mouse sat on, every second and sending them to a chip that would process them to detect movement. Later in 2004 Logitech released a Laser Mouse, which had even better tracking. This quickly became a benefit for pc gamers who wanted better tracking during battles. And other significant advances in mouse technology began to be driven by gamers such as Powerfull processors inside the mice, DPI switching, reprogrammable side buttons, etc.
